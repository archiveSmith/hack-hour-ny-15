## What are Hack Hours?
Hack hours are a series of algorithm problems to refine your problem solving skills. You will be presented a new algorithm problem every day.

## What do I need to do to get initial setup done for Hack Hours?
These steps should only be done once!
- [ ] Fork this hack hour repo.  This will create a repo on Github under your account.  
- [ ] Go to the forked version of this repo on your Github account and click the `Clone or Download` button.  Then grab the URL from that dropdown.
- [ ] Open a terminal session and navigate to the directory where you'll be working on your hack hours.
- [ ] Type `git clone <paste github URL>`.  This will create a hack-hour-# directory, where # is your cohort number.  `cd` to that directory.  
- [ ] On github, navigate back to this CodesmithLLC repo and click the `Clone or Download` button.  Then grab the URL from that dropdown.
- [ ] Back on your terminal, type `git remote add upstream <paste CodesmithLLC github URL>`.  
- [ ] Verify that you have aliases for origin and upstream by typing `git remote -v`
- [ ] These aliases should look something like this:
- origin	https://github.com/yourGithubName/hack-hour-99.git (fetch)
- origin	https://github.com/yourGithubName/hack-hour-99.git (push)
- upstream	https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/hack-hour-99.git (fetch)
- upstream	https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/hack-hour-99.git (push)

## How do I get new Hack Hours every day?
- [ ] Open a terminal session and navigate to your hack hour directory.
- [ ] Type `git pull upstream master`.  This will pull down the latest released hack hour.

## What do I do after I complete a Hack Hour problem?
- [ ] Commit your changes to your local hack hour repo
- [ ] Once your changes are committed, type `git push origin master` to push your latest commit(s) up to your github repo.
- [ ] Make sure that your Github account email setting is NOT checked for "keep my email address private" (or else you won't receive the autogenerated email).
- [ ] Go to your hack hour repository on Github and click `New Pull Request`
- [ ] Change the Base Fork branch to be your username.  You should see a green checkmark and 'Able to Merge'
- [ ] Click on `Create Pull Request`.
- [ ] Within a few minutes, you will receive an autogenerated email indicating whether your solution passed our series of tests.
